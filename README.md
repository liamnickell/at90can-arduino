# Arduino + AT90CAN
Repo that adds Arduino 1.8 support for AT90CAN.

This was done with the help of Lincomatic's work on adding Arduino (1.0) support for the AT90CAN and Atlantis Specialist Technologies' work on the Sparkfun CAN485 development board. Repos for both of these projects can be found on Github.
